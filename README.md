## 📘 RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop

Welcome to my documentation for the **RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop** conducted by **Kunal Ghosh** (Founder, VLSI System Design - VSD) in collaboration with **VSD-IAT**. This workshop offered an excellent hands-on journey into the world of digital design using **Verilog**, **open-source simulation tools**, and **logic synthesis workflows**.

The entire course emphasized working with **Sky130 standard cell libraries**, **Yosys for synthesis**, **Icarus Verilog for simulation**, and **GTKWave for waveform visualization**. It is ideal for VLSI beginners, students, and anyone aiming to build a strong foundation in digital RTL design.
